## Overview
The thermoprocessing plant model is designed to showcase a simulated industrial process involving various components:

## Features
- **Input Conveyor Belt:** Transports raw materials or components into the processing area.
- **Rotary Table:** Positions components for processing at different stages.
- **Thermic Treatment Machine:** Applies heat treatment to the components.
- **Magnetic Sensing Element:** Identifies magnetic pieces within the processed components.
- **Actuator:** Separates magnetic pieces from non-magnetic ones based on the sensing element's feedback.
